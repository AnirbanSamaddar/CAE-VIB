# Convolutional auto-encoder with variational information bottleneck (CAE-VIB)

This repository contains code to replicate results of the paper [Data-Efficient Dimensionality Reduction and Surrogate Modeling of High-Dimensional Stress Fields](). The notebook discusses application of [DeepHyper]() augmented convolutional auto-encoder enhanced by variational information bottleneck model (CAE-VIB) for modeling high-dimensional stress-field data. The dataset is generated using ANSYS APDL. Further details about the dataset and the modeling can be found in the paper.

The following are the experiments performed in the paper:

- [Result_1](): This demonstrate the training of DeepHyper augmented CAE-VIB method and generating the plots of Sec. 4.1.
- [Result_2](): This demonstrate calculating the pixel importance presented in the Sec. 4.3.
